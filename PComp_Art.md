Selected Piece: Boundary Functions by Scott Snibbe (https://www.snibbe.com/projects/interactive/boundaryfunctions/)

The piece is comprised of a square floor, a camera and projector positioned above the floor, and a computer connected to the camera and projector.  As people walk onto the floor, the camera tracks their positions.  Based on the data received from the camera, the computer generates lines between the people, which are then projected onto the floor by  the projector.  As people move around the floor, the lines are updated in real time to reflect people's movement.

According to the artist's website, the purpose of this piece is to cause people to think more about personal space, how it only exists when there are other people around to distance oneself from, and how it's constantly changing.  The artist also states that it reflects on the difference between in-person and online interactions, as at at least two people are required for any lines to be drawn on the floor.  There doesn't appear to be a specific audience for this piece, as the concept of personal space is fairly universal.  This piece is not tied to a specific location, and it has been exhibited at various locations in a number of countries.
