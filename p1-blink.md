# P1 Blink

## Experience Goal
To experiment with interactively controlling multiple LEDs through a combination of analog and digital inputs

## Summary
This project uses a digital input (a button) and an analog input (a potentiometer) to control two LEDs (in this case, one blue and one white).  The button toggles the LEDs on and off when pressed, while the potentiometer adjusts the duration that each LED is active during a 1025-millisecond cycle.

## Issues
The only major issue I encountered was trying to get the DFRobot parts correctly wired up in Fritzing.  The way they're implemented is weird, so I'm still not 100% sure everything's connected correctly.
