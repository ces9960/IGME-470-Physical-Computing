# Project 3

## Introduction

With this project, I attempted to repurpose code concepts that I'd used in earlier projects, while doing something drastically different with the hardware aspect of the project.

## Arduino Code

## P5.js Code

## Construction

### Inputs

Improvised sensor (2 DFRobot buttons, one of the plastic boxes from the Sparkfun set, a screwdriver, and some duct tape)

### Outputs

Binary counter (3 DFRobot LEDs)

Audio (serial port and p5.js)

### Assembly

Everything is attached to the plastic box, creating a device that resembes a see-saw.  The screwdriver is used as a fulcrum, the buttons are mounted to the underside of the box to detect when one side is pushed down, and the LEDs are mounted on top as a visual output.

## How it works

### Input

The user interacts by pushing down one side of the improvised sensor until a click is heard/felt, releasing it, then pushing down the other side until a click is heard/felt.

### Visual Output

The three LEDs on top serve as a binary counter (from 0 to 7), indicating the amount of times that the improvised sensor has been activated.  After the 8th time the sensor is activated, the LEDs return to their default state, as the counter is reset to 0.

### Audio Output

The Arduino sends data to the p5.js script through the serial port, which the script then interprets to play audio.  The sound's pitch is based on the count displayed by the binary counter that serves as a visual output.  Once the binary counter resets to 0, the audio returns to its lowest pitch and the waveform changes, cycling between sine, square, and sawtooth.

## Experience Goal

I didn't really have much of a goal in mind when I was making this, but it became clear that the experience of an infinitely repeating cycle is somewhat similar to how the past year has been seemingly endless.
