# Experience Taxonomy

### Emotions
The main emotion that my project represents is boredom.  In this case, the boredom comes from the monotony of an endless cycle, where things always seem to end up back where they started.

### Sounds
My project includes sound in two forms.  First is the clicking of the buttons that are pressed when the improvised switch is activated, providing feedback when the user directly alters the state of the device.  The second form of sound included in my project is the audio played through the connected PC's speakers/headphones, which represents the state that the project is in.

### Feels
The only tactile feedback in the project is when the improvised sensor is activated and the user can feel the buttons being activated or deactivated

### Periodicity
The entire project is based around the concept of endless repetition, including the LEDs lighting up in the same pattern and the p5.js audio's pitch and waveform changing in the same order every cycle.
